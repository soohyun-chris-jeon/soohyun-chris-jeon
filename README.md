### 👋 Hi there, I’m Soohyun Chris Jeon

I'm a PhD student specializing in **MRI** and **deep learning** — especially in fields like **QSM**, **motion artifact correction**.

- 👀 I’m curious about both neuroscience and how machines learn.
- 🧠 Recently exploring vision transformer models + multi-echo GRE data.
- 🛠️ Tech stack: Python, MATLAB, C/C++, PyTorch, NumPy, Git, Linux (WSL2)
- 🌱 Learning never ends — currently studying Docker, and Jekyll.
- 📚 I write and archive my journey at: [soohyun-chris-jeon.github.io](https://soohyun-chris-jeon.github.io/)
- 📫 Reach me via email or just raise an issue on one of my repos!
- 🏸 Outside the lab: Badminton, Overwatch2, and Arsenal...

> I archive everything here like a lab notebook — welcome aboard! 🔬
